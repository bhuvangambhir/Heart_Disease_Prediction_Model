# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Model  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction System** built using **Python** and **Scikit-learn**.  
The goal is to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical features.  
The model is trained on a structured dataset and deployed with a simple **Streamlit web interface**.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** CSV Heart Disease dataset  
- **Size:** 918 rows  
- **Type:** Tabular data with patient health attributes and target labels  
- **Target Variable:** Presence or absence of heart disease  

## ⚙️ Features & Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values  
- Applied feature scaling and encoding  
- Performed feature selection & engineering  
- Trained and compared multiple supervised machine learning algorithms  

## 🤖 Model  
- **Algorithms Tried:** Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting  
- **Best Model:** Random Forest Classifier  
- **Accuracy:** **88.04%**  
- **Evaluation Metrics Used:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🚀 Usage  
### 1. Clone the repository
